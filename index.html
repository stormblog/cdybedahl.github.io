<a id="what-is-dns" class="anchor" href="#what-is-dns" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is DNS?</h1>

<p>DNS is a distributed read-mostly fault-tolerant hierarchical database,
where different partitions are controlled by different people.</p>

<p>The most common <em>use</em> of DNS, by far, is to look up IP addresses from
human-readable names. It was originally created in order to do exactly
that. Still, if we want to understand DNS we must not confuse the tool
with what the tool is used for. DNS is a database. A very specialized
one, and a fairly odd one, but still a database. It has keys, which
are used to look up (or store!) pieces of data.</p>

<h1>
<a id="how-is-data-in-dns-organized" class="anchor" href="#how-is-data-in-dns-organized" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How is data in DNS organized?</h1>

<h2>
<a id="part-1-the-tree" class="anchor" href="#part-1-the-tree" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Part 1: the Tree</h2>

<p>The first and most obvious structure of DNS is the tree of names. The
sort of name we usually see on the Internet, like <code>www.google.com</code> is an
address to a specific node in this tree. Since this is a computer
science tree and not a real-world tree, the root of it is at the
right-hand edge of the name. It's also invisible, so the name in the
example above is actually <code>www.google.com.&lt;invisible root&gt;</code>.
Sometimes, when we need to be really specific, we type the dot before
the invisible root, like so: <code>www.google.com.</code>.</p>

<p>The names in the DNS tree are addresses of <em>nodes</em> in the tree.
<code>www.google.com</code> is the address of a node. <code>google.com</code> is the address
of a different node, and <code>com</code> is another one. The root node is
usually written as a single dot (<code>.</code>) when we need to refer to it.</p>

<p>We'll get to what is <em>in</em> the nodes in the next section.</p>

<p>So, if all nodes are independent and have their own addresses, what's
the point of the tree thing? Why have I bothered to mention this root
thing several times already? Well, it's pretty simple. It's how we let
different people control different parts. In DNS, we can say "You
people control everything from this node down". So, for example, ICANN
(the non-profit organization who controls the root node) has given
control of <code>com</code> to a company called Verisign, of <code>se</code> to the nation
of Sweden and of <code>ninja</code> to a company called United TLD Holdco Ltd. At
the time I write this, there are a bit over nine hundred names at the
root level. We call this process of handing over control <em>delegation</em>.
So we say that ICANN has <em>delegated</em> <code>mil</code> to the United States
military, and <code>nz</code> to the nation of New Zealand. Verisign, who as you
remember controls <code>com</code>, has delegated <code>google.com</code> to Google.</p>

<p>Delegation can only happen in between names (at the dots, so to
speak). It's not possible to give control of part of a name to
someone, and another part to someone else. That's part of why when
Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia back in
1993, the name <code>cs</code> was retired and the newly formed nations got <code>cz</code>
and <code>sk</code> instead (the other reason is that national domains are named
after their ISO 3166-1 country codes).</p>

<p>Also note that delegation does not <em>have</em> to happen. It's perfectly
possible to keep control of lots of levels of names below one you
have. As an example, the vast majority of people who control a domain
have a name <code>www</code> below that domain, and they keep control of it
themselves.</p>

<p>A name and all the names below it that are not delegated to someone
else is collectively called a <em>zone</em>.</p>

<p>We'll get back to how delegation happens technically later, after
we've talked about a couple of other things we need to know first,
since it's one of the areas in DNS that causes the most confusion.</p>

<h2>
<a id="part-2-the-nodes" class="anchor" href="#part-2-the-nodes" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Part 2: the Nodes</h2>

<p>Nodes in the DNS tree contain zero or more <em>resource records</em> (nearly
always abbreviated to RR in technical texts). Each resource record
has a <em>class</em> and a <em>type</em>, as well as some content. Let's talk about
the classes first, so we can get them out of the way and forget them.</p>

<p>There are three possible classes: <code>HS</code> for Hesiod, <code>CH</code> for ChaosNet
and <code>IN</code> for Internet. Guess which one of those you will use very,
very nearly 100% of the time? So if you look at a zone file and wonder
why it says <code>IN</code> everywhere, the answer is that back when all this was
designed nobody knew that the Internet was going to wipe out all
competition.</p>

<p>Anyway.</p>

<p>The <em>type</em> of a record is much more interesting. It specifies what
kind of data the record holds. It's the equivalent of the type of a
column in an SQL database table, except that the actual types are
pretty different. There are about 75 different kinds of resource
record types defined, but most of them are very rarely used. Only
about a dozen or so are commonly seen. The type that someone not
specifically working with DNS is most likely to encounter is <code>A</code>,
which holds an IPv4 address. The second most likely one is <code>CNAME</code>,
which is unfortunate, because it is also <em>by far</em> the most
misunderstood of all RR types. We'll spend a whole section on it
later, after we've talked a bit about how delegation works.</p>

<p>Other resource record types that may be interesting to at least have
heard the names of are:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>SOA</p>

<p>"Start Of Authority". This one must exist at the top level of each
zone, and holds some information that pertains to the zone as a
whole, such as how long caches are allowed to remember data about
it without checking with a source.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MX</p>

<p>"Mail eXchange". This one tells mail transfer agents which server
they should talk to in order to deliver mail addressed to the
domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TXT</p>

<p>"TeXT". Just a bit of text. This can have something to do with DNS
itself (the <code>se</code> zone uses one to let people know the last time
the zone was updated), or be something completely different (at
least one person have used them to implement a text adventure
game).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="putting-it-together-a-little" class="anchor" href="#putting-it-together-a-little" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Putting it together a little</h2>

<p>So we have names, which point out nodes, and in the nodes there are
records which hold data. In order to find something, for example the
IPv6 addresses associated with the name <code>www.facebook.com</code>, we use
three things as a lookup key: the name, the RR class and the RR type.
The name, <code>www.facebook.com</code>, says which node to look in, while the
class and type says which records in that node we want. Since the RR
class is in practice always <code>IN</code>, we often talk about lookups as being
"an AAAA lookup for <a href="http://www.facebook.com">www.facebook.com</a>" (AAAA is the RR type for IPv6
addresses, if you didn't guess that). There can be many records in a
node with the same class and type, as long as they have different data
in them. It's also possible for a node to have no records at all in it.</p>

<h2>
<a id="climbing-down-the-tree" class="anchor" href="#climbing-down-the-tree" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Climbing down the tree</h2>

<p>Like all databases, DNS has servers. Unlike most databases, it has
<em>millions</em> of servers. The tricky part of looking things up in DNS is
to figure out which server to ask. Fortunately, there's a procedure
for it. We start at the root, and follow a trail down. Or, I guess,
follow it left, to keep the tree directed the same way as we had it
earlier in this text. Somewhat simplified, if we want to look up the
IPv4 address for <code>www.example.org</code> it goes like this:</p>

<p>1) We: "Root servers? Give me A records for <a href="http://www.example.org.">www.example.org.</a>"</p>

<p>2) Root servers: "www.example.org? Go ask the servers for org."</p>

<p>3) We: "Org servers? Give me A records for <a href="http://www.example.org.">www.example.org.</a>"</p>

<p>4) Org servers: "www.example.org? Go ask the servers for example.org."</p>

<p>5) We: "Example.org servers? Give me A records for <a href="http://www.example.org.">www.example.org.</a>"</p>

<p>6) Example.org servers: "Sure. Here you are."</p>

<p>It's a bit more complicated in practice, of course, since we have to
find the IP addresses for all those name servers. And we need to
handle that sometimes things don't work out as they're supposed to.
Maybe the <code>example.org</code> servers give us an answer that's not so
helpful ("Go ask the root servers"), gives us one that's complete
nonsense ("CROCODILES!") or don't answer at all. But roughly speaking
this is how it works.</p>

<p>This process of following pointers down the tree is known as doing a
<em>recursive query</em> or <em>recursing</em>.</p>

<h2>
<a id="delegation" class="anchor" href="#delegation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Delegation</h2>

<p>In the description above, we blithely skate over the phrase "ask the
servers for". Let's get into that a bit more.</p>

<p>Every zone has a set of servers that have <em>authoritative</em> information
about the zone. That is, information that has been directly input from
outside the DNS system, and is treated as correct by definition. How
many such servers a zone has is up to the zone's operators, but it is
very strongly recommended that there be at least two. The list of
authoritative name servers for a zone is stored as NS records at the
topmost name of the zone. That is, the list of name servers for
<code>example.org</code> is stored as <code>NS</code> resource records in the DNS tree node
<code>example.org</code>.</p>

<p>And therein lies a bootstrapping problem. Look at steps 2 and 4 in the
description of the recursion process above. It's all fine and good to
tell us to go ask another zone's servers, but how do we know which
those servers are? Well, the answer to that is actually really easy. A
list of them is included in the response. Except that only pushes the
problem up a step, because how do the root zone servers know about the
servers for <code>org</code> or the <code>org</code> servers know about the servers for
<code>example.org</code>. It gets even worse if the servers are <em>in</em> the zone
being looked up (<code>ns1.example.org</code> and <code>ns2.example.org</code>, say),
because then in order to look up their IP addresses we already have
know their IP addresses.</p>

<p>This deadlock is broken by manual intervention. When a zone is
delegated, information about its nameservers is added to the
<em>delegating</em> zone. So externally added information about a zone's name
servers exists in two places: in the zone's own authoritative name
servers and in the delegating zone's name servers. To use the nodes in
a tree model, it is as if the node where a delegation happens has a
"shadow" node behind it, that belongs to the zone above and only has
name server information in it. The IP address information in the
"shadow" node (if any) is usually called "glue", since it's used to
stick the delegated zone to the delegating zone. You could see it as
gluing the branch to the tree, I guess.</p>

<p>The problem here, and the part that causes endless confusion, is that
the information in the two nodes (the real one and the shadow one) has
to be kept consistent manually. If there's a change of name server, it
has to be noted in <em>both</em> places. Service providers often try to hide
this from end users in their various control panels and other user
interfaces, which is a nice thought but (in my opinion) only adds to
the confusion in the long run.</p>

<p>And now it's time for a really scary part.</p>

<h2>
<a id="the-horror-of-cname" class="anchor" href="#the-horror-of-cname" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Horror of CNAME</h2>

<p>If you've been doing web stuff, you've heard about CNAME. Most likely,
you have no idea what it actually is, except that it is some sort of
magic that makes a URL go somewhere else. The amount of confusion
about this that can be found even on very serious question-and-answer
sites (like Stack Overflow and Serverfault) is staggering. Indeed,
exposure to it prompted the writing of this text, in the hope that
maybe it will stop someone somewhere at some time from having to ask a
really ignorant question.</p>

<p>So anyway.</p>

<p>CNAME is a resource record type (type number 5, to be precise). The
data stored in it is a domain name. What it does is this:</p>

<pre><code>If, when doing a recursive domain name lookup, the name being
looked up does not have any records of the requested type, but it
does have a record of type CNAME, the lookup is restarted with the
name from the CNAME record (unless the type queried for was CNAME,
in which case the lookup is complete and the CNAME record itself
is the response), and the result of this lookup is used as the
result of the original query.
</code></pre>

<p>Phew! Let's pick that apart, shall we? An example is probably easiest.</p>

<p>Let's say we want to look up the IPv6 addresses of <code>www.facebook.com</code>.
We issue a recursive query for <code>AAAA</code> records for the name
<code>www.facebook.com</code> (and of class <code>IN</code>, of course). The recursion goes
from the root to <code>com</code> to <code>facebook.com</code>. The servers for
<code>facebook.com</code> tell us that there are no <code>AAAA</code> records for
<code>www.facebook.com</code>, but there <em>is</em> a <code>CNAME</code> record. The name stored
in the <code>CNAME</code> is <code>star.c10r.facebook.com.</code>.</p>

<p>So we restart the query. Same record type, same record class,
different name. We go from the root, to <code>com</code>, to <code>facebook.com</code>, to
<code>c10r.facebook.com</code>, which tells us that there is an <code>AAAA</code> record for
the name <code>star.c10r.facebook.com.</code>, and the IPv6 address is
<code>2a03:2880:2110:df07:face:b00c::1</code>. Which then is the result of the
original query for <code>www.facebook.com</code>'s <code>AAAA</code> records.</p>

<p>That's what a <code>CNAME</code> does. That's <em>all</em> a <code>CNAME</code> does. It says to do
the query over with a different name, and pretend the result was for
the original name.</p>

<p>OK, there is one more wrinkle. If we have a <code>CNAME</code> record in a node,
we must not have any other records in the same node (except if the
zone is using DNSSEC, in which case the node may also have <code>RRSIG</code>,
<code>NSEC</code> and <code>NSEC3</code>, but you can safely pretend I never even wrote
that). The reasons for this are kind of technical and esoteric, but
for the most part boil down to "What the heck would it <em>mean</em>?".</p>

<p>An immediate consequence of this rule is that we can't have a CNAME at
the top level of a zone, since it would collide at least with the <code>NS</code>
and <code>SOA</code> records that must exist there (and the <code>MX</code> that usually does).
This annoys web hosting providers. Why it does is left as an exercise
for the interested reader.</p>

<h1>
<a id="dnssec" class="anchor" href="#dnssec" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>DNSSEC</h1>

<p>Let's conclude by saying something about DNSSEC, the addition to the
base DNS system that makes it possible to be sure that the data we
find in DNS is not fake.</p>

<h2>
<a id="the-problem" class="anchor" href="#the-problem" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Problem</h2>

<p>DNS was designed back when the Internet was a nice place, where
everyone could be trusted. This means that the only security in it is
meant to protect against accidents, not against malice. Which in turn
means that it's pretty easy for a malicious entity to corrupt the data
in it. As a response to that, eventually <em>DNSSEC</em> was introduced. It
adds cryptographic security to DNS. It also adds quite a bit of
complexity, needs more network bandwidth and memory, and makes it
vastly less forgiving of errors. Even so, I recommend that you use it
if you can.</p>

<h2>
<a id="how-it-works" class="anchor" href="#how-it-works" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How it works</h2>

<p>DNSSEC adds cryptographic signatures to DNS. Specifically, it signs
what we call <em>RRsets</em>. An RRset is simply all the RRs in a node that
have the same type and class but different data. All the <code>A</code> records,
for example, or all the <code>NS</code> records. That is, exactly the sort of
lump of information you can ask for. When DNSSEC is active (that is,
the server supports it and the query is asking for it), every RRset
gets one or more <em>signatures</em> sent along with it, in the form of
<code>RRSIG</code> records. At the top level of the zone there is also one or
more <code>DNSKEY</code> records, which contain the public half of public-key
keys. The <code>DNSKEY</code> records are used to verify that the <code>RRSIG</code>
signatures were made from the relevant RRset with the secret half of
the public key.</p>

<p>Take a moment to let that sink in. The zone has <code>DNSKEY</code> records,
which can be used to cryptographically verify signatures of RR sets
stored in <code>RRSIG</code> records.</p>

<p>That's how it works <em>in</em> a zone. Delegation from one zone to another
needs to be handled as well. This is done by adding a record type to
the "shadow" node we talked about before, the one that has data about
one zone but is actually stored in the servers of the parent zone.
This new record type, which <em>only</em> exists in the "shadow" node, is
called <code>DS</code>, for "delegation signer". It contains a cryptographic hash
of a <code>DNSKEY</code> record in the child zone, and it is signed with the
parent zone's key (or keys). So if we trust the parent, we can verify
that one of the keys in the child is OK, and we can then use that key
to verify that other records in the child are OK too.</p>

<p>So how do we know if we can trust the parent? Well, we check <em>its</em>
parent, and the delegation from it, of course. And so on up until we
get to the root zone. For that, we have to add some information
manually. It's called a <em>trust anchor</em>, and it basically is another
public half of a key. You can get it from the
<a href="https://www.iana.org/dnssec/files">Internet Assigned Numbers Authority</a>
(IANA for short). Most DNSSEC-aware software today comes with it
included, so you probably don't have to care about that, but it's nice
to know where it comes from. That key is the root of all trust in
DNSSEC, and needless to say it is handled <em>very</em> carefully.</p>

<p>That is the skeleton of how DNSSEC works. There's a mind-boggling
amount of detail that I've skipped over, like signature lifespans,
choices of cryptographic algorithms and verified non-existence (how
you can be cryptographically sure that a record does not exist). But
if you understand the description above, you have a good grasp of
where the trust in DNSSEC comes from.</p>

<h2>
<a id="advantages-and-disadvantages" class="anchor" href="#advantages-and-disadvantages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Advantages and disadvantages</h2>

<p>The one huge advantage of DNSSEC is that you can trust the information
you get out of DNS. You can <em>know</em> that the IP address you just got is
the one your bank published for its Internet banking web site, and not
something the NSA or a Russian mob injected. This in turn enables
other technologies that are just now being explored, like distributing
SSL certificates via secure DNS in order to make pretty much
everything on the Internet more secure.</p>

<p>The main disadvantage of DNSSEC is its complete unforgiveness of
mistakes. Traditional DNS is extremely resilient against doing things
wrong. You can mess things up to an amazing degree, and things will
still more or less work.</p>

<p>Not so with DNSSEC. One of the things with DNSSEC is that if the
crypto stuff doesn't verify properly, the data is treated as if it did
not exist at all. Which means that if you get things wrong at the
signing level, the entire zone vanishes from the Internet. There is no
grey area. There is no "it sort of works" as with traditional DNS.
Either it works, or the zone doesn't exist.</p>

<p>Another drawback, although less significant, is that DNSSEC makes for
quite a bit more network traffic. The response packet to an A query
for <code>www.iis.se</code> is 55 bytes without DNSSEC, 221 bytes with it. That's
a 400% increase. On the other hand, we're still talking <em>bytes</em>, not
kilobytes or megabytes, so for most people the increase is just noise.
But for a large hosting provider it can become significant.</p>

<h2>
<a id="dnssec-vs-x509" class="anchor" href="#dnssec-vs-x509" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>DNSSEC vs. X.509</h2>

<p>One criticism of DNSSEC that I've heard a couple of times is that it's
just as bad as the X.509 certificates used in SSL, since both rely on
a chain of verication back to a trusted source. I do not agree with
that criticism, and I'll try to explain why.</p>

<p>First, there is the number of trusted sources. DNSSEC has exactly one,
the root trust anchor. The Mozilla root CA bundle at the time I write
this has 177. If nothing else, it will be much more noticeable if a
single source goes bad than if one out of almost two hundred does.</p>

<p>Second, in DNSSEC the chain of trust is defined. The path of signed
data must follow the path of delegation. There can be no unexpected
detours that might introduce something bad. In X.509, there is no such
defined path. As long as there is <em>any</em> path of signed data between
the endpoint and a root certificate, the endpoint is considered to be
OK. As an example, nobody except Verisign (who controls <code>com.</code>) can
create a signed DNSSEC delegation to <code>google.com.</code>, while not only can
any of the 177 root CAs in the Mozilla bundle make a valid SSL
certificate for <code>google.com</code>, anyone to whom those 177 roots have
issued delegated CA certificates can as well. So in DNSSEC we have to
trust Verisign, while for SSL we can't even tell <em>how many</em> entities
we have to trust, much less who they are.</p>

<p>Third, in DNSSEC an operator only extends trust to the level
immediately below them. <code>com.</code> signs <code>google.com.</code>, but they cannot
sign <code>mail.google.com.</code>. In X.509, any root CA can create a
certificate for any other name no matter how distant.</p>

<p>Finally, since there can be only one trusted path to a domain, any
manipulation will be highly noticeable. In X.509, adding another
trusted path from a root CA to a certificate has no effect on any
existing certificates for the same name. In DNSSEC, changing the
signed delegation path means that the previous delegation stops
working.</p>

<p>In short, I personally trust DNSSEC a whole lot more than I trust
X.509. You, of course, get to make your own choice.</p>

<a id="thats-all-for-now" class="anchor" href="#thats-all-for-now" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>That's all for now</h1>

<p>I do hope that you now feel that you have a better understanding of
how DNS works, and that when next you see someone asking how they can
make a <code>CNAME</code> work only for some URL paths on their web site, you can
give them an <em>informed</em> chewing out.</p>
